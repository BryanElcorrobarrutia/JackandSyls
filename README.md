Gourmet Sweets Business Landing Page

Jacqueline and Sylvia's website page to attract customers to order some delicious 
Alfajores.

Recreated the original website after I learned more about web development. This version is more fancy, works on mobile. Has a simple sliding hamburger menu implemented using javascript. 

You can only see the sliding hamburger menu if you go on the website on a mobile device (or a sufficiently small screen).

Also has multiple pages now instead of just all the information on a single long page.
