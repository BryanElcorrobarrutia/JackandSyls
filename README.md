Gourmet Sweets Business Landing Page

Jacqueline and Sylvia's website page to attract customers to order some delicious 
Alfajores.

Recreated the original website after I learned more about web development. This version is more fancy and much more aesthetically pleasing.

Has a simple sliding hamburger menu implemented with javascript. You can only see the sliding hamburger menu if you go on the website on a mobile device (or a have a sufficiently small view window).

It also has multiple pages now instead of just all the information on a single long page which you can navigate through using the menu at the top.
