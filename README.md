Gourmet Sweets Business Landing Page

Jacqueline and Sylvia's website page to attract customers to order some delicious 
Alfajores.

Recreated the original website after I learned more about web development. This version is more fancy, works on mobile. Has a simple sliding hamburger menu you can 
see if you go on the website on a mobile device (or a sufficiently small screen) and multiple pages. 

See the website live on [https://bryanelcorrobarrutia.github.io/JackandSyls/](https://bryanelcorrobarrutia.github.io/JackandSyls/)
