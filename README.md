Jacqueline and Sylvia's website page to attract customers to order some delicious 
Alfajores.

Recreated the original website after I learned more about web development. This version is fancier and much more aesthetically pleasing.

<ul>
  <li>More aesthetically pleasing. </li>
  <li>Information spread across multiple pages not just a single long one.</li>
  <li>Responsive design - doesn't break on small view windows.</li>
  <li>Sliding hamburger menu implemented in javascript.</li>
</ul>

You can only see the sliding hamburger menu if you go on the website on a mobile device (or a have a sufficiently small view window).
